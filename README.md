## SheetsDB: Google Sheets as a DB

My pet project just for fun. 

This project uses [google_drive](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby) for accessing Google Drive and Sheets.

### Configuration

to be done

### TODO:

- [x] Create tables with fields (with `create_table`)
  - [ ] Add types for fields
  - [ ] Add support for foreign keys
- [x] Drop tables (with `drop_table`)
- [x] Drop database (with `drop_tabase!`)
